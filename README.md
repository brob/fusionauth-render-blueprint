# Render + FusionAuth Blueprint

This blueprint sets you up with a Postgres Database in Render and an associated FusionAuth web app and sets up the initial connection.

## Setup

_Please fork this repository. Changes to this repository can automatically update your Render instance, so best practice is to work from a Fork_

1. Log into [Render.com](https://render.com)
2. Navigate to your [Blueprints](https://dashboard.render.com/blueprints) in your dashboard
3. Add a new blueprint with the link to your GitHub repository (remember, you forked it)
4. Once the blueprint installs, navigate to the URL Render gives you for your FusionAuth web app
5. You'll start in "Maintenance mode" to finish your DB hookup. The fields should all be populated. 
6. Run the setup wizard as usual
